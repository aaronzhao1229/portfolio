        I worked as an Acoustic Engineer for 5 years after completing my studies for a Master of Engineering Studies at The University of Auckland, and am looking for the chance for my career change to the IT field.

        After working as an Acoustic Engineer for 5 years, I was aware that acoustic engineering was not what I was interested in and seeking a career change. After talking to a career consultant, programming/coding is on the top of the career list which I want to get into.

        Whilst my studies are not specific to software development, they involved programming with coding languages including C++ and Matlab. When I coded during my studies at the university, I often lost track of time and realised I was passionate about coding, although this is a field that I was not familiar with.

        Currently, I am studying a web development course at Enspiral Dev Academy. Associated languages include JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

        Apart from technology, I also love outdoor activities, such as tramping, snowboarding, surfing, tennis, mountaineering and the like. An achievement which I am proud of is the completion of Te Araroa south island part  with an extension to Stewart Island. It took me 65 days to complete. If you ask me about it, I will say "it is a fantastic journey and worth all the efforts. If you want to walk it, don’t hesitate and go ahead. Never too late.”
